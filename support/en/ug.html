  <h3 class="sub-title">How Wingman works</h3>
  <p class="text-content">
    DJI provides developers with a Software Development Kit (DJI SDK), which allows Wingman to connect to DJI drones and perform functions such as automated following flight, and telemetry information collection.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content">
    No Fly Zones (NFZ) are handled by the DJI SDK, At the moment, if a user tries to take off within a no fly zone, the DJI SDK will fail when it tries to takeoff.

    Before start connecting with other peers, you shuold set callsign and role first. After switching on network could allow users to find and connect with each other.
    Go to the searching view, select a peer and wait other agree to connect. All connected peers will appear beside the search button, user could select one as target to follow.
    Wingman supports up to 4 peers interconnections, that allow multiple drones follow with a leader.

    When selelcted leader as target and activate the auto-follow, a control point shows up on radar-view to representes the destination of your aircraft.That user could move the stick to trim the control point to adjust the distance with target aircraft.
  </p>
  <h3 class="sub-title">How Auto-Follow works</h3>
  <p class="text-content">
    If auto-follow be activated succeed, the Flight-Mode of follower would become Joystick-Mode that allow to receive the flight command directly from APP. According to leader's location, speed, altitude the app would send command continuously that makes follower maintain relative position with leader.
  </p>
  <div class="example-block left-border">
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p class="text-content">
      Two aircrafts take off at same altitude, the leader climbs to 50m height, the follower climbs to 53m height.
      then user activate auto-following, the position deviation with leader is north 5m, west 4m, height is 3m higher, leader start to move horizontally, follower also make same move direction, finally the north-south and west-east deviation would be keep the same as before, the altitude would not be changed. then the leader declines the height to 25m, the follower would declines the height to 28m.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="text-content">
    During the auto-following activating, user could manipulate the yaw stick to control the heading of aircraft but not affect behaves for auto-follow movement. Also user could control the pitch / roll / vertical throttle stick to trim the control point to adjust the distance with target aircraft.
  </p>
  <h3 class="sub-title">Safety Considerations</h3>
  <p class="text-content">
    Wingman make as much protection as possible for avoiding accident occurs duration the auto-follow flight. In below states the auto-follow would terminated by app:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Leader or follower gets weak or losts satellite signal.
    <li>Leader or follower losts its remote controller signal.
    <li>Leader gets abnormal for velocity or acceleration.
    <li>Follower below the auto-follow minimum altitude.
    <li>APP be closed by user.
  </ol>
  <p class="text-content" style="font-weight: 600; color: #5a5a5a;">
    ✳ When APP is closed abnormally by system,the Joystick-Mode may not terminated by app at that time, that require user switch the Flight-Mode switcher on remote controller to exit Joystick-Mode directly to take over control.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content" style="font-weight: 600; color: #5a5a5a;">
    ✳ If leader or follower lost its remote controller signal, the aircraft would execute the Auto-Go-Home program the same as in DJI GO.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content" style="font-weight: 600; color: #5a5a5a;">
    ✳ Because difference of performance on aircrafts, network delay, GPS locate deviation, barometric altitude deviation, ambient wind effect etc. The acting of follow could not fully synchronized within the flight formation, that require user need to be aware in flight:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the airspace is open enough for multiple drones flight safely. And the field got good satellite signal covered is required.
      <li>Setting a minimum auto-follow height (-100m ~ 100m), in case the leader make follower declines below safety altitude that need terminate auto-follow to avoid accident.
      <li>Take off, climbs upon to the minimum auto-follow height before activate auto-follow. Inactivate auto-follow before landing your aircraft.
      <li>Make appropriate position to activated the auto-follow. the distance should larger than 10m. And do not make the position on the axis of other's movement direction. If leader go horizontally the follower should have height deviation with it. If leader climbs vertically, the follower should not directly above on it nearly.
      <li>Remember the movement of leader would affect on following drones, keep a safety distance with other aircrafts. Avoid violent acceleration and deceleration.
      <li>Use the flight-mode switcher on remote controller could terminate auto-follow immediately and take over full control.
    </ul>
